My bike is a Avanti Montari 3 mountain bike. It is a great bike; I have ridden it for over 1050 km by now. I got it for my birthday. it was a great upgrade over my last bike, which had a misaligned rear wheel. 

It rides really well, and it doesn't take much to go fast. My mate bought me a bike rack and bag combo from trade me, and it has held up quite well.  I've taken many many trips with it, and also use it daily to commute to school.
