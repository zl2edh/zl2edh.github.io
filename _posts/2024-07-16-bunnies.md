A bunny is a childs term for a rabbit.
Bunnies are always cute though. I have 13 of them!

It all started when I was 6. My mum got me a bunny rabbit. However, me being a stupid kid, I lost it soon after so I got another one. Repeat. Then that years Christmas, I got my first bunny that I still have. I named him Charlie!
