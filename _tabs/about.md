Hi, I'm Hunter and this is my website! Here you will find blog posts about tech, radio and other cool topics!
I have an amateur radio licence, which allows me to transmit on frequencies otherwise disallowed.

I am interesting in too many things. Stuff ranging from fire alarms, security systems, outdoor warning sirens, ham radio, to computers, technology, cars and trucks, aviation and trains!

My [Now](/now) page has more information on my setup and my [QSL](/qsl) page has information on the ham radio side of things.
