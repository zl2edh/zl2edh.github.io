Hi, I'm Hunter and this is my website! Here you will find blog posts about tech, radio and other cool topics!
I have an amateur radio licence, which allows me to transmit on frequencies otherwise disallowed.

I am interesting in too many things that life has time for. Stuff ranging from fire alarms, security systems, outdoor warning sirens, ham radio, to computers, technology, cars and trucks, aviation and trains!

I am still in high school, navigating the ever changing education system that seems to change everytime a new government gets into power here in NZ. I'm more of a physics guy than a biology guy.

I am also a Christian! I don't really think I belong to any denomination but the church I go to the most is Anglican. I encourage you to read the bible and to learn about the gospel. Remember, Jesus Christ died for our sins on the cross, and on the third day he rose again! Here are two of my favourite quotes from scripture.

##### Ephesians 2:8-9 NIV
>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast".

##### John 3:16 NIV
>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.



>My [Now](/now) page has information on what I'm doing as of updating my website and my [QSL](/qsl) page has information on the ham radio side of things.

## Colophon
This website is built in Jekyll, using a starter template called [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page). Hosted on Github Pages. Domain is from porkbun.
I use Code - OSS on Fedora Linux to manage this website. I don't nearly update this as often as I should but it is what it is.

My website used to use Kev Quirk's [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/) framework. It looked ok but I thought the chirpy framework looked better for my usecase.

## Contact
[Telegram Channel](https://t.me/zl2edh) - If you want some not quite daily updates. But to be honest just follow my instagram lol.

If you don't want telegram you can always subscribe to my RSS feed (in sidebar) or follow my X profile (haven't tweeted in yonks). Unfortunately my website system truncates the RSS so you can't read the whole thing in your reader. :(


If you want to [email](mailto:zl2edh@proton.me) me about something really cool, please do. But if you're a spam bot then [get out](https://www.myinstants.com/media/sounds/tuco-get-out.mp3)
