Welcome to my QSL page!
Why does Jekyll make the header 'Qsl', it looks kinda bad...

## My Radios
I have 3 radios that all serve a different purpose.

### Alinco DJ-G5

This radio is a VHF/UHF dual bander. Since it's from the 90s, it doesn't do any sort of digital. It can transmit outside of ham bands which probably isn't the smartest idea. It can receive NZ UHF police radio too which can come in handy. It can also go on the NZ Marine band too! It's a real solid radio. The only negative thing is that the batteries are completely buggered, and I dont even have a charger. Thankfully it has a DC barrel jack so I used an old power supply for it. It even came with a handheld microphone and a headset (with crumbling black plastic); and a car socket adapter!


### Motorola Radius M120
This is a weird one. I think it used to be a commercially used base station radio as it doesn't have a VFO, rather just 2 VHF channels that were kindly programmed for me by the Napier ARC. It goes on the 670 and 725 repeaters in my local area. It's powered by some random 12v power supply attached to it and the antenna connecter is a mini version of a SO-25 port.

### Yaesu FT-1000MP
This one is a beast. It has an DSP and it has some decently good noise reduction! The receiever goes all the way from 30.0MHz to 0.1MHz which is really handy for listening to AM MW broadcasts or shortwave. It picks up alot of Radio China Intl from my 2 meter vertical! I haven't really tested the TX side of it becuase I haven't had a suitable antenna to TX. When conditions are right, I can hear guys from Spain! The receiver in this thing is crazy good. I have yet to connect it to my computer for CAT control and I probably should programm in some memory slots. The best thing about is that I bought it for *only $250!* I bought it off my radio club which was upgrading to an Icom IC-7300.
