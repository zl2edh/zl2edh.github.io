Right now I am getting this website sorted, working on many different things and doing many things with air cadets too.

## Books I'm reading
#### Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance
This book dives deep into american hill billy culture and how people can slide into a cycle of drug use and abuse. It is very insightful.

#### The Bible
This book is really good... and old too! I've got to make a habit of it though.

## What I'm watching
#### Various youtube videos
I almost-exclusivly watch youtube videos. I haven't sat down to watch a proper film or TV show in a while. I probably should. My youtube history is very diverse, with topics ranging from radio to memes and niche videos about trains and other cool stuff.

#### Instagram reels
My algorithim is questionable. One minute, some cool nerdy video about trains or electrical stuff, then next minute it's a video related to Instagram's favourite word. (you know what I mean)

## OS's that I'm using
#### Fedora Linux
Trusty linux distro I've been using since 2021. Never missed a beat. Rock-solid in my experience.
I use it on my laptop (dualbooted with windows 11) and have used it on my desktop PC.

#### Windows
Adobe, MS Office don't work on linux. I have to use both for school. I don't really mind using Windows because I like seeing how old parts of the OS can get and all the different things it has built in you don't normally see. I have installed ExplorerPatcher on my laptop so I get Windows 10 small style taskbar on my Windows 11 install. I do like Windows 11's design style but on my laptop the taskbar is too big for my screen size imo.

#### Android
One UI 6 on my Samsung Galaxy A53. I want to upgrade but $$$$
