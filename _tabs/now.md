Right now I am getting this website sorted, working on many different things and doing many things with air cadets too.

## Books I'm reading
### Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance
This book dives deep into american hill billy culture and how people can slide into a cycle of drug use and abuse. It is very insightful.

### The Bible
This book is really good... and old too!
