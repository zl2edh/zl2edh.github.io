Here you will find what I'm up to! Inspired by many other personal websites/blogs!

## Books I'm reading
#### [The Hunger Games](/posts/hunger-games)
I love this series. It's super cool!
I've discovered AO3 -- some messed up stuff on there...

#### The Bible
This book is really good... and old too! I've got to make a habit of it though. I've started my way down the book of Romans. Definitely recommend it.

## What I'm watching
#### Various youtube videos
I almost-exclusively watch youtube videos. ~~I haven't sat down to watch a proper film or TV show in a while~~ _cough cough hunger games_. I probably should. My youtube history is very diverse, with topics ranging from radio to memes and niche videos about trains and other cool stuff.

#### The Hunger Games
Catching Fire was the best, but I enjoyed the others. I have no idea why they thought a shaky ahh camera was good for the 1st movie. Maybe that filmmaking style was all the rage in 2011. [Read more about it](/posts/hunger-games)
All 5 movies are coming back to my local theater so you betcha I'm gonna go!

#### Instagram Reels / Youtube Shorts
My algorithim is questionable. One minute, some cool nerdy video about trains or electrical stuff, then next minute it's a video related to Instagram's favourite word. (you know what I mean). I'm getting alot of christian reels too!
On youtube shorts, it's a mix of podcasts, gen alpha brainrot, and tiny channels posting about cool stuff. (similar to niche fb groups) -- Oh, and that 'you wanna see something cool?' guy, iykyk

## OS's and computers that I'm using
#### Fedora Linux
Trusty linux distro I've been using since 2021! It's the middle road between Debian and Arch so it's been rock-solid. Fedora is what I use to make this website! The Gnome workflow seems really intuiative. People complain about not having a minimize button but with dynamic workspaces I don't see why you'd need it. I do have KDE installed too when I feel like it. I use it on my laptop (dualbooted with windows 11) and have used it before on my desktop PC. (Can't be bothered now. I know.)

#### Windows
Adobe, MS Office don't work on linux. I have to use both for school. I don't really mind using Windows because I like seeing how old parts of the OS can get and all the different things it has built in you don't normally see. Basically, I also like windows, at least before MS got in and enshittified it lately. I do like Windows 11's design style. On my PC I have themed it to look like windows 7...

#### Android
One UI 6 on my Samsung Galaxy A53. I want to upgrade but new phones are expensive... I like how intuitive android is, and how you can sideload apps, unlike iOS.
I used to have an iPhone 8 Plus. The one thing I miss about it is iOS's design. The apps that look like native apps look so good. The only thing I didn't like was the way the home screen worked.

#### iOS
I have an iPhone 8 plus that i pull out of the drawer every so often. I love the native app style, at least before liquid glass. If iPhone had sideloading and slightly cheaper hardware I would switch. One good thing about iOS is that every social media app is way more polished than their android counterparts.

### My Laptop
My laptop is an ASUS VivoBook M1503Q. I thought I got the 144hz version but i got the 60hz (pays to look at the details of what you buy on pbtech) ☹️ - This laptop is what I'm using to make this website. This laptop has been absolutly rock solid and I still get impressed by the OLED on this thing.

![the only photo i could find of my laptop](/assets/images/laptop.png)
_The only photo I could find of my laptop. Here I'm programming an ESP32 for WLED (didn't work out in the end, but I've still got it so I might use it)_

### My PC
I also use Windows 10 on my desktop PC, a Acer Nitro 50 I got for free! I've upgraded the GPU to a GTX 1080, the RAM to 32GB and have added a few HDDs for storage. It's i5-10400 isn't the most powerful but I can't exactly complain. I use it for all sorts of things, from gaming to creative work to watching youtube. Linux was too much of a hassle on it as I use Adobe and Microsoft Office. I tried booting Windows 7 on it too but that somehow caused my SSD to fail. It worked in another computer though but not the Acer. I still don't know why that is.

## Vehicle's I Drive

### 1998 Toyota Corolla
The liftback version of a 1998 toyota corrola is the best corolla in my opinion. It is an absolute dream to drive and everything feels tight. The accelerator is a little soft but then again it's not a sports car.

### 2005 Toyota Wish (JDM!)
This JDM station wagon beast has a massive blind spot in the form of a massive pillar going down the side of the windscreen. This means if the road angle is a specific curve to the right then I can't see oncoming traffic. It also drives like a tank, which is not a compliment.
